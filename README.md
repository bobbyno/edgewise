# Edgewise

Edgewise is a simple tool and library for representing and computing on networks (graphs) in Clojure.

At a high-level, edgewise fits into preliminary network exploratory data analysis by facilitating
easy translation of an adjacency list into a format that a network visualization tool like yEd or Gephi
can read.

```
raw data -> edge list
edge list -> edgewise
edgewise -> TGF
edgewise -> d3json
edgewise -> dot
edgewise -> graphml
edgewise -> ...
```
